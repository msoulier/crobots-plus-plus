# crobots-plus-plus
This project is a re-implementation of the classic [Crobots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crobots) MS-DOS program, the point of which was to design a virtual robot using
a simple K&R C syntax and API, and enter it into combat with up to three other such
robots. 

The interface to the original was a simple ASCII text "rendering", and the source
code for the robots was compiled into memory each time the game was run, compiling for
what was essentially an emulator. The source code could be identified by their .r
file extensions.

# Goals
We started this project with the following goals in mind:

- It should be fun to implement, and fun to use
- We can do better than ASCII graphics, even though I still kind of like them myself
- The robots should be object-oriented, implementing a pre-defined interface.

More to come.
